#### Explain the concept of error boundaries in React.

**Error boundaries are special React components that catch JavaScript errors during rendering**, in lifecycle methods, and during the constructor of whole tree below them. They are used to handle errors gracefully by displaying a fallback UI and preventing the entire application from crashing due to unhandled errors.

You can use [react-error-boundary](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-error-boundary) package to create **error boundaries** in your application. It provides a *ErrorBoundary* component that you can wrap around any component that might throw an error. Tne *ErrorBoundary* component takes a *FallbackComponent* prop that is used to render a fallback UI when an error occurs.

#### Example:

```js
import { ErrorBoundary } from 'react-error-boundary';
import { FetchData } from './FetchData';

function ErrorFallback({ error, resetErrorBoundary }) {
  return (
    <div role="alert">
      <p>Something went wrong:</p>
      <pre>{error.message}</pre>
      <button onClick={resetErrorBoundary}>Try again</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export function App() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}>
      <FetchData />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
```
