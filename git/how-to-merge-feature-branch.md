To merge your feature branch with many changes into the main branch, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your local repository is up to date
    
    `git checkout main git pull origin main`
    

- Switch to your feature branch
    
    `git checkout your-feature-branch`
    

- Update your feature branch with the latest changes from main
    
    `git merge main`
    
- Resolve any conflicts if they occur.
- Push your updated feature branch to the remote repository
    
    `git push origin your-feature-branch`
    

- Switch back to the main branch
    
    `git checkout main`
    

- Merge your feature branch into main
    
    `git merge your-feature-branch`
    

- Push the updated main branch to the remote repository
    
    `git push origin main`
